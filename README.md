So, I got bored, wanted to speriment a bit with Rust, and love GameBoy games, here's the result!

I really enjoyed the process, but have no idea what the final result should be, for now at least.

Open to contributions and ideas!

## Run / Build
```bash
# Run the game
cargo run

# Run the game in creative mode to build levels
cargo run creative
```
